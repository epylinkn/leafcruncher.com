**at the bottom of the swimming pool** invites viewers to descend, play and listen.

piano notes mix with field recordings, sketching sonic pathways for brief contemplation. a tree with wings grows from the interactive sculpture. blank leaves and refracted sound offer an empty canvas of flattened time.
