**PORTAL**, also known as **there is still time**, is an installation in the bombay beach desert bordering california's storied salton sea.  

100 TVs were transported from a hotel in Times Square to be given a new life on the decaying shores of Bombay Beach. each TV was mounted inside of a structure designed by joylabo and networked together using raspberry pis. each day the portal captures the sunset and replays it slowly over the course of the remaining evening. 

as part of the inaugural year of Mars College, the portal also functions as a creative canvas for its community.
