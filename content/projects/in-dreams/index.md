**IN DREAMS** is a full-body instrument exploring skating as it is in my dreams...\
&emsp; without gravity\
&emsp;&emsp; without endings\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; and, most importantly, without bruises.

for whatever reasons, i was never really excelled at skateboarding when I was younger. yet, my imagination was always wild with possibilities. i set out to bring that imagination to life.

deep down, this instrument explores my anxiety and shyness. and so i composed the music and designed the instrument to force myself to play loudly. here, it is performed live using a custom instrument designed to encourage large gestures, taking up space, and a joyful smile. the instrument was developed for _new instruments for musical expression_.
